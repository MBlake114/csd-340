                            <p>I've enjoyed reading for as long as I've been able to read. I usually prefer fantasy and Science Fiction books but I have also read numerous other books in almost all the Genres that exist.
                                Some of my favorite books are The Lord of the Rings, Catch-22, and Dune.

                            <p>I've been playing video games for about as long as I've been reading books.  My first experience with video games was my parents Sega.  
                                From there I have had every Xbox console and I even got lucky enough to secure the Xbox Series X on day one.

                            <p>I grew up on a farm and have been working with tools for most of my life.  I've recently been trying to translate those skills into making furniture
                                as opposed to buying overly priced furniture that will likely break in a few months.
